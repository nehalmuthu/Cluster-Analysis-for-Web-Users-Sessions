## Overview:
- Targeted Advertisement, product/offer campaigns, providing discounts to lure in customer, etc are some of the major application areas of e-commerce.
- All the above mentioned application requires segmentation of customers so as to ease the marketing of products.
- While there are traditionally many ways to group users/customers based on their personal characteristics, this projects aims to categorize them based on their navigational patterns (i.e. pattern in webpages visited by a user) observed from their user sessions. 
- Based on the page visits of a user we categorize the users.
- We do a group wise analysis of page hits which can be used to understand the needs of each segment.
- Additionally we build a user network based on sessions and do community detection to identify similar users for targeted advertisements. 
- Also a web-page network is built in order identify important pages in a website. Based on the transition probability matrix formed we find the probability of page transitions.
- Finally, we have build a network plot for user and colored each node based on i) age category ii) location, so as to check for the characteristics of a group.

I personally spent a lot of time understanding and interpreting the dataset. So I will boil it down for you guys.

## Dataset:
- I have provided the dataset in the Data folder.
- To learn more about the dataset go to (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/msnbc.com+anonymous+web+data)
- Go to the above mentioned link and under data folder you will find msnbc990928.seq.gz.
- Download and extract. You will get .seq file, you can view it using notepad++.
- It is not much different from .txt, so you can read it normally using “fopen” in python(for reference check the code folder).

## Understanding the Dataset:
- Each line in the dataset represents a user session. 
- Assume each line to be a user.
- Each line is something like this :  2 12 3 4 12 12
- Meaning user has visited page 2 then 12 followed by 3, 4 and again 12.
- The website MSNBC is an American news-based pay television cable channel.
- It contains different pages like sports, medical, economy, accident, education, etc.
- Each website is denoted by a number.
- So for instance, page 2 means it’s a sports page.


## Pre-processing of data:
- Each row represents a user.
- So basically we are gonna cluster each row.
- For that we need a feature vector that represents each user/row.
- So we form a n*14 matrix, where n is the number of users, 14 is the no of pages in msnbc.com.
- Each user is represented by their page visits.
- Now we have the dataset ready, deploy all your algorithms using the data.


## How to check and run the code: 
- Just open the codes under Code folder in google colab
- It has all the required tutorial links and documentations.

## Output:
You can check the final output in index.html (wait for a couple of seconds to load)

## Reference:
Relevant research papers are given under the Paper folder.\
